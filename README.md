## Learning outcomes:
Got practice with DOM methods and CSS flexbox.
Learned about slider in CSS.
Spent significant time creating gridMaker and then later to figure out a way to reset grid and call gridMaker again with user input.
Practiced using transition in CSS. 
Learned about git revert and fastforward.

## Known issues: 
Page loads as intended on computer using google chrome but it does not render correctly on firefox by default: use 50% zoom as a work around.
Touch is not working as intended on mobile.
I will not be going back to try and fix these issues, instead will continue learning, work on other projects, and keep these issues in mind when writing CSS in the future.
